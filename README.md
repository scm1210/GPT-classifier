# GPT-classifier

A example of how to build a classifier using GPT

## Folder/File breakdown 

- Data-Viz: folder with relevant data for producing confusion matrices 

- Data: subset of the data to run the script 

- Examples: Two csvs, which were used to feed the classifier the examples

- Output: The output from our classification task

- Skills-share-example.ipynb: the script you can run to follow along

## Some other things

This is an example of how to use the OpenAI API to leverage the capabilities of GPT for social science research, demoing stuff I learned at SICSS :). Slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AGCCTx4P9hJgpK4U5ErOzWRJZioKl3DflwyD59KOEJ4/edit?usp=sharing). 

In order for this script to run, you will need to generate an API Key via OpenAI's website. You can do that [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key). Please do not share this with anyone, store it in an .env file, and add it to a .gitignore file to avoid any breaches.
