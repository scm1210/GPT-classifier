He was a tall, active fellow, and his long strides soon brought him to a house a little way out of the town, which was evidently the abode of some degree of taste and luxury. The house was of wood, painted in dull colors of red and brown; it had large comfortable verandas under shingled roofs. Its garden was not old-fashioned in the least; but though it aspired to trimness, the grass had not grown there long enough to make a good lawn, so the ribbon flowerbeds and plaster vases of flowers lacked the green velvet setting that would have made them appear better. The student was the less likely to criticise the lawn because a very nice, fresh - looking girl met him at the gate.'\n",

I asked him if he had any suggestions as to what we might do. He said the only thing he could think of was to try Canada or even Newfoundland. I explained that all we wanted was a few hours on the beach. He said he’d never seen the air so full of brokendown old wrecks as it was that day.

She had become obsessed with the idea that without those trotting fingers on the chain, Dr. Jenkins couldn’t talk. He was the only man Milly knew who had a watch chain, or for that matter, the only man she knew who wore a vest.

Who knows the reason one leaf falls and another remains? But Ole and Trufa believed the answer lay in the great love they bore one another. Ole was slightly bigger than Trufa and a few days older, but Trufa was prettier and more delicate. One leaf can do little for another when the wind blows, the rain pours, or the hail begins to fall.

They snuck away to Wembley to watch the Freddie Mercury tribute concert, and when Annie Lennox opened her mouth to sing, Grace understood what it meant for your breath to be taken away.

      " 'However true this may be in the main, — and it undoubtedly is true that in ordinary times the speculative and innovating temper of an original mind is less safe than the patience of routine and persistence in precedent of a commonplace one, - - there are critical occasions to which intellect of the highest quality, character of the finest fibre, and a judgment that is inspired rather than confused by new and dangerous combinations of circumstances, are alone equal. Tactics and an acquaintance with the highest military authorities were adequate enough till they were confronted with General Bonaparte and the new order of things.

We look upon them somewhat as interlopers, parasites, occupying a place to which they have no legitimate right. Our manners, like the machinery of our government, are too new to be smooth and polished ; they occasionally grate. We are more prone to worship the golden calf, in bowing down before the favorites of Fortune, than disposed to kill the fatted calf in honor of the elect of thought and mind. Each and every one of us thinks himself as good and better than any other man : an invaluable creed, when it engenders self-respect ; but, alas ! when we put it in practice, it is generally with a view of pulling down to our level those whose level we could never hope to reach.'\n",

The age passing away was one of uncommon upheaval and tumult it had its Garibaldis and John Browns as well as its Bismarcks and Louis Napoleons.

One can study three years at a German university for the same price that it would cost him for two years at Harvard, Johns Hopkins, or Cornell. Besides, the great advantage of travel is included in this price. Further, the much greater ease with which the German language can be acquired when once among the people themselves is no mean inducement. Many may go relying upon the mere fact of their having studied in Germany, or their having obtained a German degree, to secure them a good position upon their return. The confidence of these, however, seems to lead to the great cause underlying this migration. Why should our educators and trustees who have the power of appointing to good positions prefer German graduates to such an extent ? The answer must be that they are better informed, and that the German university system is superior to ours.'\n",

The tobacco industry's success at winning from Congress what it wanted while still providing the lawmakers with an opportunity to appear to be all in favor of health was a brilliant stroke. The industry brought it off because the tobacco lobby employed unusually skilled and well-organized strategy; because it hired some of the best legal brains and best-connected people in Washington to help with the fight; because it successfully grafted onto its built-in congressional strength from tobacco-producing states a sufficient number of congressmen to whom the issue was not one of health, or even of the tobacco industry, but one of curbing the powers of regulatory agencies, such as the FTC; and because it succeeded in throwing a heavy smoke screen around the health issue.

It had been badly shaken by his own miscalculations of the mood of his country and the seriousness of the troubles which engulfed his government, by hesitation and uncertainty in the handling of the crisis, and above all, by the shattering economic effects of one of the most complete strike shutdowns which any democracy has suffered in normal peacetime. The device which De Gaulle chose to reassert his personal power, once the crisis had been overcome, was simple, typical, and ruthless. He fired the man who had been his greatest strength and the architect of his victory, Prime Minister Georges Pompidou.'\n",

      " 'The poor look different from year to year, and depending on how they look, they go in and out of fashion. When Michael Harrington and (thanks in part to Harrington) John F. Kennedy discovered the poor in 1962, they were a pitiable lot, usually represented as gaunt Appalachians in faded work clothes. Five years and a score of urban riots later, the poor had become a less congenial crowd, uniformly black and best known to the viewing public through a handful of telegenic, hypermacho spokesmen. By the time Ronald Reagan arrived to lead the right‘s war on \"welfarism,\" the poor had been virtually condensed into a single, thoroughly repellent image: a young black male, apprenticing as a mugger, who had figured out how to buy vodka with food stamps. But demography must sooner or later triumph over ideology.'\n",

Advances in neurochemistry and pharmacology, they say, are now driving the study of human behavior, and it is time for the profession to wake up to this fact. Psychotherapies will always play a role in the treatment of mental disorders—but only those psychotherapies that can pass clinical trials.'\n",

Finding an excellent cocktail is easier now than at any time in the past century. Yet there remains one fortress the revolution has yet to breach: the \"upscale casual\" restaurant chain—think Ruby Tuesday, Outback Steakhouse, Chili\\'s—where beverage managers have long crouched on the battlements, ready to pour upon the invaders vats of treacly, electric-blue sugar syrup.

      " \"Beowulf, of precarious provenance—the single surviving, crumbling manuscript bears the scorch marks of an 18th-century library fire—has traveled across a thousand years to lodge in our imagination like some kind of radioactive space nugget. A story from a pre-Christian era written down by an anonymous Christian, in alliterative Old English verse, it has an otherness, a real frosty interstellar otherness, but also a mysterious resonance. It's holding something for us, this poem, the value of which is inseparable from its long and lonely transmission. And so we keep going back to it, we wonderingly retell it, testing it on our tongues like the syllables of a dream. The past 20 years alone have given rise to two feature films, a TV series, and no fewer than four graphic novels based on the poem, including one released this January.\"\n",
      " 'The cumulative effect on British police shows can’t be overstated. Everyone weaned on American cop dramas, for instance, knows the right way to approach a door behind which a suspect might be waiting: His gun drawn, an officer stands to one side before knocking and declaring himself loudly. The anticipation of violence is so primal that it dominates almost every interaction that involves the police. In your typical British police show, by contrast, a visit to a suspect can resemble a social errand, as unarmed detectives wait patiently in front of a door after ringing the bell. The absence of gunfire—and, more important, of concern about the possibility of gunfire—almost invariably leads to more actual detective work.']\n"
